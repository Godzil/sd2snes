v0.1.1
======

 * initial public release


v0.1.1a (bugfix release)
========================

 * Fixes:
   - SuperCIC pair mode was erroneously enabled in firmware binary
   - SNES menu crashed on empty database


v0.1.2
======

 * New menu entry: "System Information"
 * Auto region override (eliminate "This game pak is not designed..." messages)
 * Improved mapper detection (fixes Batman vs. Joker and many PD ROMs)
 * Improved data streaming performance
   (should reduce MSU1 errors with some cards)
 * A and B buttons swapped in menu to match common key mappings
 * Fixes:
   - MSU1: Stop audio playback on end of audio file


v0.1.3
======

 * Updated logo gfx with new version from klaptra
 * Updated font to distinguish between 1 and I
 * Menu layout adjusted to move status line up by 4 scanlines
 * Run previously loaded game by pressing Start in the menu
 * Auto-scroll file names that do not fit the screen
 * SD access time measurement on System Information screen (takes a while!)
 * Cx4 memory map: mirror ROM to 40-7e/c0-ff (fixes MMX3 Zero patch)
 * Some FPGA configuration error detection (mainly useful for hardware diag)
 * Fixes:
   - FPGA-side SD clock pullup (increases reliability with some cards)


v0.1.4
======

 * SPC Player (contributed by necronomfive/blargg)
 * System Information screen now shows CPU/PPU revision (contributed by necronomfive)
 * Satellaview: basic data transmission packet support (makes some more games boot, thanks to LuigiBlood for assistance and sample data packets)
 * Number of supported files increased to 50000 per card / 16380 per directory
 * Slight speedup of menu text rendering
 * Reduce load time of menu
 * Adjust Cx4 timing to be more faithful
   (Mega Man now defeats the boss in attract mode in Mega Man X2)
 * adapt ROM mirroring size to file size if header information is invalid
   (fixes Super Noah's Ark 3D, possibly others)
 * MSU1 interface changes suggested by byuu:
   - Data offset 0 and audio track 0 are automatically requested on reset.
     This causes the busy flags to become 0 shortly after reset/startup.
   - $2000 bit 3 is now "audio error", becomes valid after "audio busy" -> 0
     set when an error occurred while preparing playback of the requested audio track
 * write LED stays on when SRAM content changes constantly
 * Fixes:
   - fix empty save files on FAT16 / incorrect free cluster count on FAT32
   - correct directory sorting (force parent directory at top of list)
   - fix text corruption when entering a directory with a scrollable name
   - fix files/dirs count in system information
   - make 'sd2snes' directory hiding case-insensitive
   - improve DAC IÂ²S timing
   - fix occasional palette corruption in menu
   - fix SD clock glitch on ROM loading (occasional glitches/crashes)
   - fix memory write timing on ROM loading (occasional glitches/crashes)
   - fix SPI timing (ROMs not loading; System Information not working)
   - properly synchronize SNES control signals (occasional glitches/crashes)
   - fix floating IRQ output (occasional glitches/slowdowns)


v0.1.4a (bugfix release)
========================

 * Fix DMA initialization in the menu (could cause sprite corruption in some games)


v0.1.5
======

 * Sort directories by entire file name instead of first 20 characters only
 * Correctly map SRAM larger than 8192 bytes (HiROM) / 32768 bytes (LoROM)
   (fixes Dezaemon, Ongaku Tsukuuru - Kanadeeru)
 * SPC player: fix soft fade-in (first note cut off) on S-APU consoles
   (1CHIP / some Jr.)
 * More accurate BS-X memory map
 * Ignore input from non-standard controllers (Super Scope, Mouse etc.)
 * Fixes:
   - minor memory access timing tweaks
     (should help with occasional glitches on some systems)
